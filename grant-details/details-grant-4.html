                <h4>Light manufacturing is a section of an
            economy’s secondary industry characterized by less 
            capital-intensive and more labor-intensive operations.
             Products made by an economy’s light industry tend to be
              targeted toward end consumers rather than other businesses; 
              it is the production of small consumer goods.
   The facilities typically have less environmental impact
    and are usually less capital-intensive than heavy industry. 
    The objective is to provide support for asset and utility acquisition for light manufacturing operations.
   The fund shall be deployed for the provision of equipment
    and working capital loans to local companies engaged in light
     manufacturing across the country.
   The purpose is to finance the acquisition of production/processing
    equipment, utilities (generators, transformers, forklifts etc.) and working capital.</h4>
