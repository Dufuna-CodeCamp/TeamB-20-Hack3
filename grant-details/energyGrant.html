                            Eligible projects will receive grants in the range of N1,000,000 and N3,000,000 and will be judged against a number of 
                            criteria including, their potential contribution to socio-economic development in the form of livelihoods opportunities, local employment,
                            income and value creation, women economic empowerment, as well as replicability and scalability of the projects.

                            evaluate socio-economic impact data, and share learnings.
