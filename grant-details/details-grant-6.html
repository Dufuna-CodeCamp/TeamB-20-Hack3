                            Afrigrants introduces the Healthcare Sector Research and Development Intervention Scheme (HSRDIS) to help strengthen the 
                            public healthcare system with innovative financing of research and development (R&D) in new and improved drugs, vaccines and diagnostics 
                            of infectious diseases in Nigeria. Specifically, the HSRDIS is designed to trigger intense national R&D activities to develop a Nigerian vaccine, 
                            drugs and herbal medicines against the spread of COVID-19 and any other communicable or non-communicable diseases through the provision of grants 
                            to biotechnological and pharmaceutical companies, institutions, researchers, and research institutes for the research and development of drugs, herbal 
                            medicines and vaccines for the control, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. The Scheme is intended to boost domestic manufacturing of critical 
                            drugs and vaccines to ensure their sustainable domestic supply and reduce the
                            bulk manufacturing costs of the drugs, herbal medicines and vaccines in Nigeria.
