        <h4>
            Our organisation introduces the Healthcare Sector Research 
and Development Intervention Scheme (HSRDIS) to help strengthen the 
public healthcare system with innovative financing of research and 
development (R&D) in new and improved drugs, vaccines and diagnostics 
of infectious diseases in Nigeria. Specifically, the HSRDIS is designed
 to trigger intense national R&D activities to develop a Nigerian vaccine, 
 drugs and herbal medicines against the spread of COVID-19 and any other 
 communicable or non-communicable diseases through the provision of grants 
 to biotechnological and pharmaceutical companies, institutions, researchers, 
 and research institutes for the research and development of drugs, herbal 
 medicines and vaccines for the control, prevention and treatment of infectious 
 diseases. The Scheme is intended to boost domestic manufacturing of critical 
 drugs and vaccines to ensure their sustainable domestic supply and reduce the
  bulk manufacturing costs of the drugs, herbal medicines and vaccines in Nigeria.
